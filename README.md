# Pomodoro Timer In C#👌😮👓👓
* **Brief Introduction**🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
*Nowadays, there are so many distractions, making more and more people struggle to stay on top of their tasks. When you see a message on Facebook or a new video on YouTube, you think to yourself, “Oh, I’ll just take a few minutes to check these things.” That few minutes turns into half an hour, that half an hour turns into a few hours, and the next thing you know, you have to do something else.So how do we get our tasks done without getting distracted? The secret is using “Pomodoro’s,” the Italian word for tomatoes, rather than hours. The Pomodoro Technique is a popular time management technique that allows you to work in sessions with small breaks in between.*
 **To be more Pragmatic 👌😮🎗👓:**

* **Step 1**:  Creates a to-do list and grabs a timer.

* **Step 2**: Focuses on a single task for precisely 25 minutes.

* **Step 3**: Once the timer rings,  writes down what have been  completed and mark off one Pomodoro.

* **Step 4**:  Takes a 5-minute break.

* **Step 5**: Check the total sessions spent.
